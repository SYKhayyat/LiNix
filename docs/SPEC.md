# LiNix v7 — the declarative model

**Status:** design complete, nothing built.

Supersedes [`docs/AUDIT-v6.org`](AUDIT-v6.org) — the audit that found all of this — except
where Part VI carries an item forward explicitly. Part VI carries everything you need;
read the audit only for the underlying evidence (the measurements and the `file:line`
citations behind each finding).

---

## PROMPT — read this first, then follow it

You are implementing LiNix v7 on branch `v6` at `C:\Users\Administrator\Videos\Nexus\linix`.
This document is your specification. It was produced by a long design conversation with the
owner; **every rule in it was argued for and chosen, and Part V records why.**

**Before you write a line of code:** read Part I and Part II in full. Read Part III's "What
already exists". You cannot implement this correctly from a summary.

### Rules of engagement

1. **Part II is canonical.** If the code disagrees with Part II, the code is wrong. If Part
   II seems wrong, **stop and ask** — do not fix it yourself.
2. **Never change a Part II rule without reading its Part V entry first.** Each is the scar
   of a real bug. Most "obvious improvements" here are things we already tried and rejected;
   Part V says why. If Part V doesn't cover your case, that is a real gap — **ask.**
3. **Ask before every real decision.** The owner makes the decisions; you are responsible for
   bringing things to their attention. Explain clearly, in plain words, no jargon, as if to a
   smart new intern. **Do not use metaphors.** Give real context and a recommendation.
4. **Never remove a feature without asking**, even one this document doesn't mention. Some
   may be genuinely important. The deletion list in II.17 is already approved — anything
   beyond it is a question.
5. **Do not invent.** If the spec doesn't say, it's a gap. Ask. Do not guess and do not
   quietly pick a default — that is how this codebase got eleven magic numbers nobody can
   change (V-P5).
6. **Commit at every major step**, with a message that says what changed and what it does not
   yet do.
7. **Check everywhere. We cannot afford bugs here.** This codebase's flagship bug ran
   `apt-get purge` on hundreds of system packages during a routine test.
8. **Report honestly.** If tests fail, say so and paste the output. If you skipped a step,
   say that. If you're unsure something works, say you're unsure. Never describe unverified
   work as done.

### How to work

- **Follow Part III's phases in order.** Phase 0 is pure deletion and comes first
  deliberately: do not carefully port something you are about to delete.
- **Phase 2 cannot be split, and the branch is red for a long stretch.** That is expected. Do
  **not** run the old and new models side by side behind a flag — that is the exact "two ways
  to do one thing" disease this whole design cures, applied to ourselves.
- Every phase has an **exit condition**. Meet it before moving on.
- `cargo test` and `cargo clippy` must be green at every commit outside Phase 2's interior.
- Part IV lists the specific proofs. They are not optional.

### The three principles that decide arguments

- **Fail loud, never silent.** Every bug in this codebase is the same bug: something didn't
  work and said nothing. Given a choice between a wrong answer and a visible error, take the
  error. Always.
- **There is no legacy.** No users exist. No migration path, no compatibility shim, no
  deprecation warning, no old-format reader. Delete legacy branches on sight.
- **A comment states a constraint the code can't show. Nothing else.** Not what the line does.
  Not where it came from. Not that it's good. This repo has ~884 comments that break this
  rule, written by models congratulating themselves; do not add the next one.
  *(The figure was 139 in the first draft, measured against an older, smaller tree. Re-measured
  2026-07-16 across 2,147 comment blocks.)*

---

**How to use this document.**
- **Part I** — principles. Never violate these. If a decision seems to conflict with one,
  the decision is wrong, not the principle.
- **Part II** — the target state. This is what to build. It is canonical: if code disagrees
  with Part II, the code is wrong.
- **Part III** — the work, in dependency order.
- **Part IV** — how to know it's right.
- **Part V** — why. **Every decision in Part II has an entry here.** Do not change a
  Part II rule without reading its Part V entry first; each one is the scar of a real bug.
- **Part VI** — bugs: killed by this design, and carried forward as real work.

Facts marked **(measured)** were verified against real containers or real code with a
citation. Everything else is design.

---

# Part I — Principles

**P1. Every imperative command is a shortcut for editing a file and syncing.** Nothing can
be done only imperatively. If a command can make a change that no file could have made,
that command is a bug.

**P2. There is no legacy.** There are no existing users and we do not want legacy. No
migration path, no converter, no compatibility markers, no deprecation warnings, no
old-format readers. Every "legacy" branch in the codebase is dead weight for nobody. Delete
on sight.

**P3. Fail loud, never silent.** Every bug in this codebase is the same bug: something
didn't work and said nothing. When the choice is between a wrong answer and a visible
error, take the error.

**P4. A fact lives in one place.** A fact stored twice is a fact that will disagree with
itself. Compute, don't copy.

**P5. A default without a reason cannot be safely changed.** If you add a number, add the
reason. If you can't state the reason, don't add the number.

**P6. A comment states a constraint the code can't show. Nothing else.** Not what the line
does — the line does that. Not where it came from — git does that. Not that it's good —
that's the reader's call.

---

# Part II — The target state

## II.1 Files on disk

**Your repo** — `$LINIX_CONFIG_DIR` or `~/.config/linix`. **This is a git repo.**

```
modules/            your lists              lowercase names       *.txt
profiles/           your choices           Capitalized names
active              which profiles are on
priority            which backends, in order
schedules           when LiNix runs itself
locks/              what everything resolved to    one file per backend
preferences.toml    refusals and behaviour
```

**LiNix's data** — `$LINIX_DATA_DIR` or the platform data dir. **Never in git. Never in a
folder LiNix scans.**

```
registry.json       what LiNix currently owns
snapshots/          snapshot metadata, tagged with commit hashes
```

**Secrets** — the environment only. `LINIX_GITHUB_TOKEN`. Never a file.

**Facts about this machine** — **detected, never configured.** Core count, whether btrfs /
ZFS / Timeshift exists and where, which backends are installed. LiNix looks; it does not
ask you to maintain them by hand on every machine forever.

## II.2 Grammar

### Lines

A file is lines. A line is blank, a comment, a statement, or a block.

```
# whole-line comment                          anywhere
apt:curl                    # trailing        anywhere on a statement
```

**An unrecognised line is an error.** Not a package name. The error names the file, the
line number, and what was expected.

### Statements

```
NAME                          bare package — backend resolved via `priority`, then locked
BACKEND:NAME                  explicit backend
BACKEND:re:PATTERN            regex — matches names in that backend
absent:BACKEND:NAME           declare it must not exist
repo:SPEC                     a repository
shim:NAME                     a shim
schedule:NAME                 a scheduled task (only in `schedules`)
service:NAME                  a service
link:SOURCE                   a managed file
use NAME                      reference a module (lowercase) or profile (Capitalized)
```

`use` takes **a name. Never a path, never a URL.** A file from the internet is a fetch step
that puts a module on disk; then you `use` it by name like everything else.

### Options — two forms

**Short form.** `@key=value,key2=value2`.
**A comma in a value is an error**, not a guess: *"commas need the block form."*

```
apt:jq@version=1.6                    ok
apt:jq@version=>=1.0,<2.0             ERROR → "commas need the block form"
apt:curl@2.0                          ERROR → "did you mean @version=2.0?"
```

**Block form.** Everything after the first `=` to end of line is the value: **verbatim,
trimmed.** No escaping is possible and none is needed.

```
apt:nginx {
  after_install = ./setup.sh --flag=a,b
  requires      = apt:libfoo
  requires      = apt:libbar          # a key given twice makes a list
}
```

- **A value cannot contain a newline.** If you need one, that's a file, not an option.
- **`#` does not start a comment inside a block value.** The value includes it.
- A block value containing ` # ` triggers a hint: *"block values are verbatim — did you mean
  a comment? Put it on its own line."*

### Blocks

**The header decides what the body is.** `module` and `when` are keywords; their bodies are
lines. Anything else is a declaration; its body is options.

```
module fancy {          keyword → body is lines
  apt:neovim
}

when os == linux {      keyword → body is lines
  apt:htop
}

apt:nginx {             declaration → body is options
  after_install = ./setup.sh
}
```

**`when` gates the lines inside it. One rule, everywhere** — in a module those lines are
packages; in a profile they're imports; in `priority` they're backends. To gate a whole
file, wrap it. Keys: `os`, `arch`, `host`, `hostname`, `family`. Operators: `==`, `!=`,
`in [a, b]`.

### Option keys

| key | meaning |
|---|---|
| `version` | exact or range |
| `hold` | never upgrade. **`@hold` + `@version=` is a contradiction → error** |
| `expires` | **absolute** datetime. Present now, absent after |
| `until` | **absolute** datetime, on `absent:` only. Absent now, present after |
| `requires` | `BACKEND:NAME` — install that first. **A bare name is an error** |
| `after_install`, `before_install`, … | a hook. Hashed and locked |
| `source` | on `shim:` |
| `cron`, `run` | on `schedule:` |
| `target`, `content`, `template`, `decrypt`, `identity` | on `link:` |
| `enabled`, `status` | on `service:` |

## II.3 Modules

- A module is a **list of lines**.
- **The filename is the module name, lowercased.** `Editors.txt` → module `editors`. A file
  with no `module` block is one module named after the file. Anything outside a block
  belongs to the file's own module.
- **A module can `use` other modules. A module can NEVER reference a profile.** The layering
  rule.
- **`modules/*.txt`. The folder decides.** Anything else in `modules/` is silently ignored,
  so a `README.md` costs nothing.
- **LiNix only parses what the active profiles reach.** `linix check` parses everything on
  demand.
- **No `present:`.** A bare line already means present.
- `-` subtraction does not exist in modules. `absent:` does.

## II.4 Profiles

- Set math over modules and profiles: `|` union, `&` intersect, `\` difference, `-`
  subtract, parentheses. Directives `include` / `exclude` / `intersect`.
- **A profile MAY hold package lines directly.** Cost, accepted knowingly: a module can
  never reach them (layering rule), so they are unshareable, permanently.
- **Only profiles can be activated.**
- `absent:` does not exist in profiles. `-` does.

## II.5 Naming

- **Profiles are Capitalized. Modules are lowercase.** `(Work | gaming) & security` tells
  you what everything is with zero noise.
- `use` disambiguates a reference from a package. Case disambiguates profile from module.
- Filenames are lowercased into module names, so a filename can never mint a profile.
- **Error messages must teach the rule:** *"no profile named `Editors` — did you mean the
  module `editors`? Profiles are Capitalized, modules are lowercase."*

## II.6 The other files

**`active`** — a plain list of profile names, unioned. Answers exactly one question: *what
is this machine set to right now?* Nothing else goes in it.

**`priority`** — an ordered list of backends, with `when` blocks.

```
when host == laptop {
  apt
  cargo
}

apt
dnf
cargo
snap
```

**Listed = available to LiNix, in this order. Not listed = LiNix does not use it at all** —
`snap:foo` errors with *"snap isn't in your priority list."*

**`schedules`** — lines, with `when` blocks. **Being in the file means it's on.** No
active-list.

```
schedule:nightly {
  cron = 0 3 * * *
  run  = sync
}
```

`run=` is hashed and locked exactly like a hook.

**`locks/`** — one file per backend. **Generated. In git. Yours.** Records:

| | |
|---|---|
| version | `apt:curl → 7.81.0` |
| **resolved backend for a bare name** | `ripgrep → cargo:ripgrep@14.1.0` |
| **regex expansion** (only if frozen) | `re:^texlive- → [312 names]` |
| **hook script hash** | `fonts:after_install → sha256:a3f1…` |

`linix lock` regenerates. `linix lock <name>` regenerates one. `linix lock --backend cargo`
regenerates one file.

**`preferences.toml`** — refusals and behaviour. **Nothing writes to it but you.**

## II.7 Resolution

1. Read `active` → the profile expression set.
2. Resolve profiles → the module set. Profiles may reference profiles; modules may not.
3. Parse **only** the modules reached. Apply `when`.
4. Resolve each line. Bare names use `priority`, then the lock.
5. **Two active declarations that contradict = ERROR.** Stop, show both, name both files.
   Not first-wins, not file order.
6. **Dated lines:**
   - **A dated line stops counting once its date passes.**
   - **While it is counting, a dated line beats an undated one.** *(The only exception to
     rule 5.)*
7. Produce the desired state.

**Ordering is the planner's job, never the file layout's.** Repos first → refresh indexes →
packages (native dependency graph + `@requires` edges) → things depending on packages
(services, shims, links).

**What LiNix may remove: what it manages and you stopped declaring. Plus `absent:`. Nothing
else, ever.**

## II.8 Commands

| command | does |
|---|---|
| `install PKG… [--into NAME]` | write the line, sync |
| `uninstall PKG… [--temp]` | remove the line from every active module, sync |
| `forget PKG…` | drop from the registry. Stays installed. LiNix never touches it again |
| `adopt [PKG]` | take over the machine, or one package |
| `sync` | make the machine match |
| `plan` | show what sync would do |
| `check` | parse everything, report errors |
| `lock [NAME]` | freeze versions / expansions, approve hooks |
| `purge-unmanaged` | delete everything LiNix doesn't manage |
| `clean` | ask each backend to tidy its own orphans |
| `unmanaged` | what `adopt` would adopt |
| `absent` | every `absent:` line in force, and its module |
| `diff COMMIT COMMIT` | the change in **packages**, not text |
| `teleport PKG BACKEND` | edit the line, sync |
| `shell` | throwaway shell. Outside the model |
| `bundle` | git bundle + artifacts + registry |
| `export FORMAT` | Brewfile / requirements.txt / package.json |

**`shell` must be honest about being outside the model:** it writes no module, and **stops
recording transient packages in the registry** — which is what lets a session's leftovers
look like managed drift later.

**Destroying a file you wrote** (e.g. `module create` over an existing file) is a **plain
refusal plus `--force`**, like every other tool. It has nothing to do with packages and must
not be wired to a setting about removals.
| `upgrade`, `list`, `status`, `doctor`, `activate`, `deactivate`, `profile`, `service`, `repo`, `hold` | as today, all reduced to file edits |

**Every command prints the file it touched:**
`Added jq to modules/imperative.txt (used by profile Work)`

**`--into` takes a module (lowercase) or a profile (Capitalized).**

**Three landing modules, named for how the package arrived:**

| module | arrived via |
|---|---|
| `imperative` | `linix install` |
| `hooks` | `apt install`, caught by the hook |
| `adopted` | `linix adopt` |

The first time LiNix writes to one, it adds `use <name>` to the active profile and **says
so**. A normal line you can read and delete. **Never implicit.**

**`uninstall` warns about inactive declarations:** *"jq is still declared in module
`gaming`, which isn't active. It will come back if you activate Gaming."*

**`uninstall PKG --temp` on an undeclared package is an error:** *"steam isn't declared, so
there's nothing for it to come back to. Did you mean a plain uninstall?"*

**`--backend` is allowed on read-only and upgrade; REFUSED on anything that removes.**
`plan`, `list`, `upgrade` → yes. `sync`, `purge-unmanaged` → error: *"scoping a removal
isn't safe; use a profile."*

**`clean` goes through the guard** — ask the backend what it intends, check the list against
protection, refuse if it touches something protected. **Sync nudges:** *"3 packages are now
orphaned; run `linix clean`."* Want it automatic? `schedule:tidy { run = clean }`.

## II.9 Adopt

**Adopt takes manually-installed packages only. Never the dependency closure.**

**(measured)**

| Backend | Record | Result |
|---|---|---|
| apt | `apt-mark showmanual` | 103 of 579 |
| pacman | `-Qqe` | 11 of 173 |
| conda | `env export --from-history` | 4 of 88 |
| winget / choco / scoop | installs no dependencies — everything **is** chosen | exact |
| **pip** | **none.** No flag separates dependencies | **adopt nothing, say why** |

**Base-image packages ARE adopted** — `grub-pc`, `linux-image-generic`. They keep the
machine bootable, and `purge-unmanaged` deletes what isn't declared.

**Output:** one `modules/adopted.txt`, grouped by backend with comment headers, sorted.
Header states: this is an estimate; deleting a line uninstalls; `linix forget` is the way
out. A second section lists OS-essential packages, commented out.

**Adopt does NOT consult `protected_packages`.** This resolves **E7**, where "protected"
means two opposite things: *never remove* in the guard, *never adopt* in `migrate.rs`.
**Protection means one thing: never remove.** So adopt takes every manual package including
protected ones; protection then prevents their removal. This is a **change from what Stage 2
built** — Stage 2 routed adopt's skipping through `guard::protection_of`, which unified the
code while keeping the word ambiguous. Adopting a protected package is correct: it belongs
in your file, and deleting that line is refused (V.26).

## II.10 The guard — nine refusals, one function

| | |
|---|---|
| `protected_packages` | never remove this |
| `unprotected_packages` | …unless I say so. **Wins over everything, including OS-essential** |
| OS-essential | never remove what the OS says is load-bearing |
| `max_removals` (default **20**) | never remove more than this at once |
| `max_installs` (default **unset**) | never install more than this at once |
| `deny_packages` | never install this |
| `pinned_only` (default **off**) | never install anything without an explicit `@version=` |
| `require_snapshot` (default **off**) | never change anything when no snapshot can be taken |
| `deny_vulnerable` (default **off**) | never apply when `audit` reports a managed package vulnerable |

All in `[guard]` in `preferences.toml`. One decision function. **Every removal path calls
it** — sync, `absent:`, expiry, `purge-unmanaged`, `clean`, shell exit, `uninstall`. The
last three also gate *installs* and *changes*, so the install paths call it too.

**A confirmation asks; a refusal says no.**

| | `-y` |
|---|---|
| sync shows the plan and asks | **skips** |
| `max_removals` exceeded | **cannot skip.** `--allow-mass-removal` |
| `max_installs` exceeded | **cannot skip.** `--allow-mass-install` |
| hook script new or changed | **cannot skip.** `linix lock` |
| protected / OS-essential | **nothing overrides** |
| `purge-unmanaged` | **cannot skip.** Typed confirmation |
| `pinned_only` / `require_snapshot` / `deny_vulnerable` | **cannot skip.** They are refusals (V.43) |

**The plan always leads with the counts** — not a threshold, not a warning, just the plan
being readable:

```
Plan: install 30,207 · remove 0 · upgrade 3
  30,102  re:^lib
      98  apt
       7  cargo
```

## II.11 `purge-unmanaged`

- **The guard is a RATIO, not a count:**
  ```
  LiNix manages 3 packages.
  This will remove 576, including python3, libc6, and bash.
  That looks like you haven't adopted this machine yet.
  Run `linix adopt` first, or --i-really-mean-it if you're sure.
  ```
- `max_removals` does **not** apply (it catches accidents; this is deliberate).
  `protected_packages` and OS-essential **always** apply.
- **Snapshots first**, automatically. **If none is available, say so loudly** — *"there is no
  undo for this"* is the most important sentence this command can print.
- **Shows the whole list.** 576 packages is 576 lines. The pain is the feature.
- Docs state the residual risk in these words: adopt is an estimate; if it missed something,
  this deletes it.

## II.12 Hooks and the supply chain

**The lock is the approval.** `locks/` records each hook script's hash. Hash mismatch →
**stop**:

```
module `fonts` (from github:x/y) changed its after_install script since you approved it.
  was: sha256:a3f1…   now: sha256:9c2e…
Run `linix lock fonts` to see the new script and approve it.
```

**Hash everything, including your own scripts.** One rule, no exceptions.

**`plan` shows the trust, before anything happens:**

```
module `fonts` (github:x/y)
  adds repository  ppa:fonts/testing
  runs script      after_install: ./setup.sh   [approved]
module `dev` (local)
  runs script      after_install: ./build.sh   [CHANGED — needs approval]
```

## II.13 History

**Git is your intent. Snapshots are your machine.** Two jobs, two mechanisms, neither
pretending to be the other.

**A generation IS a git commit. LiNix commits only on a successful sync** — so every commit
in your history is a state your machine **actually reached**.

- `git log` = where your machine has been.
- **`git diff` and `linix plan` are the same question.**
- Rollback can never take you somewhere that never worked.

**Order: snapshot → apply → commit.** On failure, restore the snapshot and don't commit —
files and machine agree, because the snapshot brought `registry.json` back with it.
**Tag the snapshot with the commit hash.**

**Rollback = `git checkout` + `sync`.** The registry is always current; its history is not
stored, because declaration + convergence reproduces it. **There is no generation format.**

**Snapshots are a preference**, default on if the machine can do it (btrfs, ZFS, or
Timeshift). Retention prunes — **one engine** (`retention`), not two.

**No commit algebra.** Git covers what's real:

| you want | git |
|---|---|
| union of commits | `merge` |
| take that one change | `cherry-pick` — "roll back but keep the jq I added" |
| undo that one thing, keep the rest | `revert` |
| chained and nested | branches |
| **intersect of commits** | **nothing. No such operation, no use case found** |

**Integrity is `git commit -S`.** LiNix checks that git says the commit is signed, and by
whom. **`locksig.rs`, `.linix-lock.key`, and the fail-open branch are deleted.**

## II.14 Version pins — precedence

1. **`@version=` in a module** — you wrote it. **It wins.**
2. **`locks/`** — generated; fills in everything you didn't pin.
3. **Nothing** — whatever's current.

A hand-written pin disagreeing with the lock is **not an error** (today it fails the run).
You wrote it, it wins, LiNix regenerates the lock to agree and says so.

## II.15 Regex

**`re:` prefix. Live by default, lockable when you want it frozen.**

**The lock file IS the switch.** Entry in `locks/` → frozen. No entry → live, re-evaluated
every sync. `linix lock texlive` freezes one; delete the entry and it's live again.

**`plan` shows which is which:**
```
re:^fonts-      live    1,043 packages today
re:^texlive-    frozen  312 packages
```

**(measured)** `apt:re:^python3-.*` → 4,447. `apt:re:^lib` → 30,207.

**Residual hole, accepted:** `texlive-foo` renamed to `tex-foo` silently drops one package.
One package, recoverable, snapshot has your back.

## II.16 Everything is a line

| Today | Becomes |
|---|---|
| `linix repo add` (**stores nothing**) | `repo:ppa:deadsnakes/ppa` |
| `linix shim jq --source cargo:jq` (**`--source` discarded unread**) | `shim:jq@source=cargo:jq` |
| `linix hold jq` (machine-local `registry.json`) | `apt:jq@hold` |
| hooks table in config | `apt:nginx@after_install=./setup.sh` |
| `linix schedule add` (**writes config**) | a line in `schedules` |
| `@lease=2h` (**inert today**) | `apt:jq@expires=2026-07-17T14:00` |
| `remove --temp` (**loses to sync**) | `absent:apt:jq@until=…` |
| `bloatware.txt` | `absent:apt:libreoffice` in a module |

A repo and the package needing it are **one fact**:
```
module python-latest {
  repo:ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
  apt:python3.12
}
```

**Expired lines linger.** LiNix must not rewrite your files. It mentions them, **naming the
exact file and line** — never vaguely. Only the dated line is dead; the undated one is doing
real work and must stay.

# Part III — The work

## What already exists on branch `v6`

Four stages of the old plan are committed. **Read this before deleting anything.**

| | commit | fate |
|---|---|---|
| **Stage 1** — the guard, backend manual-listing labels, apt `showmanual`, conda `--from-history`, essential parsing, `unmanage` | `47f82b6` | **Keep.** Becomes Phase 3's foundation. The `ManualListing` taxonomy and `guard::protection_of` are the right shape. |
| **Stage 2** — `Migrator::discover()`, one crawl shared by migrate and audit, `manual_source()`, atomic manifest write | `9847544` | **Keep.** Becomes `adopt` (II.9). **Except** its protected-skip — see II.9, E7. |
| **Stage 3** — harness config isolation, the `okf` coverage ratchet, the JSON-check fix | `d1b1edc` | **Mostly superseded.** The harness is rebuilt in Phase 5. Keep the isolation and the ratchet idea. |
| **Stage 4** — the `-g` overlay model, `wish_dirs()`, `config_root()`, `is_reserved_manifest` | `fb9f08c` | **Thrown away.** Phase 0 deletes `-g` entirely. This is real work that this design discards, knowingly (V.1). |

**Stage 4 is a deliberate write-off.** It correctly fixed `-g` by making it additive; the
new model deletes the flag instead. Do not try to preserve it.

## Phase 0 — Delete

**Pure subtraction. Nothing new can break. Tests stay green except those testing deleted
features.** Do this first so nothing is carefully ported that was about to be deleted.

Delete everything in II.17. Delete the ~884 marketing comments. Delete every legacy branch
(`generation.rs` bare-filename keys, the `<name>/`-directory profile form).

**Exit:** `cargo test` green. Codebase measurably smaller. Report the line count removed.

## Phase 1 — One parser and the grammar

**C13 and the grammar are one job, not two.** The grammar *is* the parser; unifying five
parsers against the old grammar just to rewrite them is work done twice.

- One `backend:name` parser. **(verified)** Five exist today; three skip backend validation,
  including the manifest hot path. Every new prefix (`absent:`, `repo:`, `shim:`,
  `schedule:`, `re:`) is a thing a non-validating parser reads as a backend name.
- Reserve `re` against the onboarder's custom backends.
- `{ }` blocks. Header decides body kind (keyword → lines, declaration → options).
- Comments: whole-line, trailing on statements, **never inside block values**.
- Options: short form (no commas), block form (verbatim to EOL), repeated key = list.
- `@2.0` → error. `@requires=bar` (bare) → error.
- **Unknown line → error**, naming file, line, and what was expected.

**Exit:** unit tests for every grammar rule above, including every error case.

## Phase 2 — The model (the cliff)

**Cannot be split.** Everything above the seam breaks at once. Do not run two models behind
a flag — that is the "two ways to do one thing" disease, done to ourselves.

- The layout (II.1). `modules/`, `profiles/`, `active`, `priority`, `schedules`, `locks/`,
  `preferences.toml`.
- The resolver (II.7): profiles choose, lazy parsing, conflicts are errors, the layering
  rule, dated lines.
- Profile set algebra, resolved at read time. **No `_active_profiles.txt`, no
  materialization.**
- `PackageSpec` gains **present/absent**. That is the only new thing the desired-state map
  can't already carry.
- Ordering phases in the planner: repos → index refresh → packages → dependents.
- The command surface (II.8).

**The seam:** everything upstream produces `HashMap<backend, Vec<PackageSpec>>`; everything
downstream consumes it. `src/backends/` (11,193 lines), `src/core/` (4,499), and
`src/parsers/` (2,275) — **~45% of the codebase — never notice this happened.**

**Exit:** the harness green on one distro.

## Phase 3 — The guard

- 16 → 5 (II.10). One decision function.
- **Every removal path calls it.** Today's misses: `uninstall` (C1), leases and `absent:`
  (C3), ghost-shell exit (C8), `clean`.
- One lease-expiry implementation (C9 — two exist today with different semantics).
- The ratio check and `purge-unmanaged` (II.11).
- `unprotected_packages` must beat OS-essential (B3 — the code clears the config rule, then
  falls through to the OS check, which fires anyway).

**Exit:** a test per removal path proving the guard fires.

## Phase 4 — Locks and git

- `locks/` (II.6): version, resolved backend, frozen regex expansions, hook hashes.
- Commit on successful sync only. snapshot → apply → commit. Tag the snapshot.
- `git checkout` + `sync` = rollback. Delete the generation format.
- `linix diff COMMIT COMMIT` in packages, not text.
- `bundle` = `git bundle` + artifacts + registry, **honest per-backend about what can't be
  bundled**.
- One retention engine.

**Exit:** an air-gapped container restores from a bundle, or bundle says why it can't.

## Phase 5 — Harness and docs

- Rebuild the harness for the new model.
- **G2:** 104 of 245 assertions are `soft` and cannot fail. Convert or register as debt.
- **G3:** teleport, adopt, shim, cockpit, undo are effectively unverified.
- **H2:** two error-swallows on safety paths — `sync/mod.rs:463` (failed rollback-remove
  goes unreported), `shell/mod.rs:126` (dropped state write).
- **F4:** `--help` asks the registry for the backend count. The README line is generated.
- **F1:** `network_timeout_secs` — **honour it** (today every consumer applies an
  undocumented `.max(10)` floor, so setting 5 silently gives you 10).
- **F1:** `max_parallel` — detect the core count.
- **F1:** the generated `priority` file carries its reason in a comment (V.14).
- **F5:** fix the false doc comments.
- **P6** goes in `CLAUDE.md`.

## Phase 6 — The five containers

`DISTROS="ubuntu fedora arch alpine tools" ./docker/integration/run.sh jq`

Owed from the last sprint; not run since Stage 2.

---

# Part IV — Verification

**The specific proofs, on the ubuntu image:**
- After `adopt`, the registry holds ~103 packages, not ~579, and does **not** contain
  `libperl5.38t64`.
- `python3` is still installed at the end of the run.
- A large removal is refused without `--allow-mass-removal`.
- `purge-unmanaged` with an unadopted machine is refused by the ratio check.

**Grammar:** a test for every error in Part II.2. Each must produce an error, not a guess.

**Resolution:** two modules declaring the same package differently → error naming both files.

**Guard:** one test per removal path in Phase 3.

**Hooks:** a changed script hash refuses under `-y`.

---

# Part V — Why

> **Do not change a Part II rule without reading its entry here.** Each is the scar of a
> real bug.

**V.1 — Why `-g` died.** `Config::groups_dir` meant two things: the wish-list folder, and
the anchor for `locks.json` / `keep.txt` / `local.txt` / profiles. `-g` moved both, while
`registry.json` — the ownership record — never moved. So `plan -g /B` read /B's one package
against an ownership record claiming 579, called 578 of them drift, and purged the machine.
`-g` is gone because "which folder" stopped being a question anyone asks: files are storage,
modules are the unit, profiles choose.

**V.2 — Why profiles choose and modules hold.** It's the one sentence that explains the
whole system. The moment profiles hold things or modules make choices, it stops being true.
A module can never reference a profile (the layering rule) because otherwise "what does
`editors` contain?" has a different answer depending on what you activated — the library
cannot depend on the app.

**V.3 — Why a profile may still hold packages.** Decided knowingly against V.2's tidiness,
because `--into Work` is a real want. The cost is real: those packages are unshareable
forever, and you find out the day you want to share them.

**V.4 — Why `group:` and `include:` died.** `group:editors` pointing at a file was **already
a no-op** — the resolver seeded every `.txt` unconditionally, so the file was loaded before
you named it. It looked like opt-in and wasn't, which taught people a wrong model of how
LiNix decides things. `include:` strictly superseded it.

**V.5 — Why conflicts are errors.** Files were read in filesystem order and first
declaration won. `a.txt: jq@1.6` vs `b.txt: jq@1.7` was decided by the disk. Sorting the
read order only makes the wrong answer deterministic.

**V.6 — Why `keep.txt` died.** It lived in the groups folder and ended in `.txt`, so the
resolver ate it: *"never remove firefox"* also silently meant *"install firefox"*. It was
held back by a hardcoded one-element denylist. **Separate by location, not by denylist** —
and `forget` gives people the thing they actually wanted, which was a way to make LiNix let
go.

**V.7 — Why `absent:` is the one exception to "only removes what it manages".** Because you
named it. Everything else LiNix touches, it owns. `absent:` is you reaching outside that,
deliberately, by name. It stays a line rather than a file because a file can't be turned off
per profile, can't be shared, and puts LiNix's bookkeeping back in a folder you author.

**V.8 — Why blocks use `{ }` and not `( )` or `end`.** `( )` is already the grouping operator
in profile math — same character, two meanings, the trap we removed from `include:`. `end` is
clumsy. "Pick your own delimiter" means nobody can read anyone else's files.

**V.9 — Why block values are verbatim and `#` doesn't comment inside them.** Fail loud. If
`#` commented there, `after_install = curl -H "X: #tag"` silently truncates and runs the
wrong command. The other way, `version = 1.6 # my pin` gives a version the parser visibly
rejects. **You reached for the block form precisely because you needed a value the short
form couldn't hold. Verbatim is what you asked for.**

**V.10 — Why no quotes.** `"` needs `\"` needs `\\` needs a newline rule. The block form
makes the problem stop existing rather than giving it a rule.

**V.11 — Why the extension is cosmetic.** Nothing is active unless a profile names it, so
`use editors` against a misnamed file says *"no module named `editors`"* with a list. **The
reference is the safety net**, not the extension.

**V.12 — Why adopt takes manual-only.** Not because 579 is a big number. **Declaring a
dependency breaks dependency management.** Put `libgpm2` in a module and you've declared it,
so LiNix keeps it forever; remove vim and it stays, because apt says "orphan" and your file
says "I want this" and the file wins. Monday's bug was claiming ownership of a set that was
never LiNix's.

**V.13 — What "estimate" means.** apt records that something was **explicitly requested** —
not **who** requested it. Canonical's installer marked ~90 packages manual at image-build
time; they are indistinguishable from the `apt install vim` you typed. There is no field for
"a human, on purpose." **(measured)**

**V.14 — Why the priority order.** Most of the current 10-backend order is **meaningless** —
apt, pacman and dnf never coexist. The order that decides something is **system manager vs
language manager**: if both apt and cargo have `ripgrep`, the **system one wins**, because
your distro maintains it and updates it with everything else. Language managers are for what
your distro doesn't carry. That also explains pip last: it installs into your system Python
and can break it. *(uv and pipx being absent from the order is simply a bug.)*

**V.15 — Why `priority` also means "enabled".** One list, one question: *which package
managers does this setup use, and in what order.* It replaces four settings for one fact
(`backend_priority`, `enabled_backends`, `hostname_backends`, `default_backend`) of which
only two merge today. An explicit `snap:foo` failing when snap isn't listed is a feature: it
catches typos and makes your backend set declared rather than inherited.

**V.16 — Why bare names get locked.** LiNix *probes* — "does apt have ripgrep?" So `ripgrep`
lands on cargo today, Ubuntu adds it tomorrow, and the same unchanged line resolves to apt:
LiNix uninstalls from cargo and installs from apt because a repo you don't control changed.
**The bare name is the question; the lock is the answer.**

**V.17 — Why regex is live by default.** "Give me all the fonts, including ones that don't
exist yet" is real. Mandatory locking turns a living pattern into a frozen list and defeats
the point of writing a pattern. **The lock file is the switch** — that's how every lockfile
already works.

**V.18 — Why regex matches names, not meaning.** `photo*` finds `photocollage`,
`photoprint`, `photoqt` — and misses `gimp`, `darktable`, `krita`, `rawtherapee`,
`shotwell`, `digikam`, `inkscape`: every actual photo editor. Real prefix *families* are the
good use (`texlive-*`, `fonts-*`). Debian's own answer to a family is a **metapackage** —
someone's judgement rather than a naming coincidence — and better where one exists.

**V.19 — Why `max_removals = 20` works and `max_installs` has no default.** **20 is more
than a person removes on purpose** — calibrated against human behaviour, so a plan removing
50 is wrong at any scale on any machine. **Installs have no equivalent ceiling: the biggest
install you'll ever do is the correct one** (a fresh machine). So `max_installs` exists but
defaults to unset — the number is yours, for your reason. *(Rejected: screen height — the
same command would behave differently on different machines. Rejected: a ratio — a fresh
machine's ratio is undefined.)*

**V.20 — Why the ratio catches Monday and a count doesn't.** On Alpine, `adopt` correctly
took 14 packages and a mis-scoped `prune` scheduled all 14 for removal — **under the count
limit, none protected, all things you'd cry about**. The count misses it on small machines.
**Manage 3, delete 576 → you have made a mistake, on every machine, always.**

**V.21 — Why `purge-unmanaged` is a command and not a mode.** **Sync is then never
dangerous** — not "safe by default", but safe permanently. No setting anyone can flip,
inherit, or copy from a dotfiles repo makes a routine sync delete something it didn't
install.

**V.22 — Why `-y` cannot skip a refusal.** Every CI job and every script passes `-y`, and an
unattended run cannot notice a machine being dismantled. **`-y` means "don't ask me". It has
never meant "ignore your safety rails", and every place it currently does is a bug.**

**V.23 — Why `confirm_destructive` died.** In a declarative system, **deleting a line is the
confirmation.** You said what you wanted; asking whether you meant it is asking twice. And
the setting named after removals gated a module-file overwrite (not a removal) while missing
both `prune` and `sync`.

**V.24 — Why the plan always leads with counts.** **A warning that only fires sometimes is a
mechanism that can be miscalibrated. A summary that's always there can't be.**

**V.25 — Why the 16 protections became 5.** **Eleven of them were never protections — they
were declarations wearing a protection costume.** "Don't remove this, it's leased" →
`@expires=`. "…you installed it imperatively" → it's in the `imperative` module like
everything else. "…it's held" → `@hold`. "Do remove this, it's bloatware" → `absent:`. Each
existed because there was **no way to say the thing directly**, so someone bolted an
exception onto the removal path instead. `protect_imperative` is the clearest: it exists
*purely* to stop drift-pruning deleting `linix install`-ed packages, because they lived in
`local.txt`, which `-g` could move out from under the registry. **Someone met Monday's bug,
understood the symptom exactly, and patched it with a flag.** Not one behaviour was deleted;
they moved to where they were always trying to be.

**V.26 — Why protection is a refusal, not a declaration.** Everything else is a statement of
intent ("I want this"). Protection is "I will not do that, and there is no flag." It doesn't
care whether the package is managed, declared, adopted, or predates LiNix. That's why it
lives in preferences and not in a module — and why deleting a declared `apt:python3` line
makes LiNix refuse until you unprotect it.

**V.27 — Why hooks are lines despite the supply chain.** `use` is **already** a trust
decision: a `repo:` line in someone's module means they can ship you any package with any
script in it. Hooks make that road shorter, not different in kind. **The lock is the
approval** — because you approve a script once and they edit it three months later, which is
how most npm incidents actually worked: the malicious version was never the one anyone
reviewed. **Hash everything, including your own scripts**, because "did I write this?" has
no clean answer once you've cloned your own repo onto a second machine — and the friction
that catches you editing `setup.sh` is the same friction that catches a teammate's `git
pull`.

**V.28 — Why schedules got their own file.** `active` answers exactly one question: *what is
this machine set to right now?* A schedule is written once and forgotten — a fact, not a
switch. An active-list for schedules would invent a state that needn't exist ("defined but
off"), so you'd check two files for one fact. And the separate file means a cron job can't
arrive via `use` at all. **Door left open, deliberately unbuilt:** "sync nightly when I'm in
Work" — a `schedule:` line can live in a module and be selected by a profile; the grammar
already allows it.

**V.29 — Why `@requires` survives.** **(verified, `planner.rs:407-426`)** `spec.requires`
becomes a real `graph.add_edge` — install **ordering**. A module is a *set* and says nothing
about order. `@requires` is the one thing modules can't say. It matters only for things
outside a package manager (a `.deb` from a URL, a GitHub binary) — things with **no one to
ask**. apt's own dependencies are ordered for free at `planner.rs:427`.

**V.30 — Why git is the history.** **LiNix commits only on a successful sync, so every
commit is a state your machine actually reached** — not one you asked for. `git log` is
where your machine has been; `git diff` and `linix plan` are the same question; rollback can
never take you somewhere that never worked. And the registry needs no history, because
declaration + convergence reproduces it.

**V.31 — Why no commit algebra.** Set math works on profiles because they're choices you're
making *now*. Commits are moments that already happened, and "the union of March and today"
isn't a machine anyone asked for. Git covers what's real. **Intersect of commits does not
exist in git and no use case was found** — twenty years of git not having it is evidence.

**V.32 — Why lock signing died.** **Signing one file in a folder of unsigned files protects
nothing.** Anyone who can edit `locks.json` can edit your modules — they'd change `apt:jq`
to `apt:evil` and no signature would notice. It guards one door in a building with no walls.
Ours was `sha256(key + "|" + text)` — a construction cryptographers warn against — compared
with `==`, which leaks timing. And **appearance is worse than nothing, because you stop
looking.** `git commit -S` signs everything, with real crypto, verified by a tool that's been
attacked for twenty years.

**V.33 — Why `clone` died.** It copied **the installed set, not the intent** — you got a
machine with the same packages and no idea why. `git clone && linix sync` gives the intent,
the history, the pins, and the ability to change it afterwards.

**V.34 — Why `prune` and `orphans` died.** sync removes drift by definition, so `prune` is
sync with the install half amputated. "Prune" meant four unrelated things; deleting the
command leaves exactly one meaning ("delete old history") for the first time. `orphans`
shows what sync would remove, which is `plan` — and its message named two commands and
described neither.

**V.35 — Why `--backend` is refused on removals.** A scoped removal is Monday's exact shape:
**you narrow what LiNix looks at without narrowing what it owns**, so everything outside the
scope looks like drift.

**V.36 — Why `clean` survives.** It's apt's housekeeping, not LiNix's drift, and only apt
knows about it. It goes through the guard because `autoremove` is a mass removal LiNix
didn't plan and has famously eaten desktop environments. It stays explicit because automatic
cleanup is a surprise removal.

**V.37 — Why suspensions survive.** Nearly deleted — "I want this and I don't want this"
smells like a contradiction with a timer. The case that saves it: **"take the game away
until the weekend."** People genuinely do that; nothing else here does it; and once leases
exist, suspensions are the same machinery pointed the other way.

**V.38 — Why times are absolute.** "2 hours" can't work in a file: the machine reading it
next week has no idea when you wrote it. That's exactly why `@lease=2h` is inert today.

**V.39 — Why `install`/`uninstall`/`forget`.** A symmetric pair plus one word that can't be
misread. `remove` and `unmanage` sat one word apart and did opposite things to your disk —
reach for the wrong one and you don't get an error, you get a deleted package.

**V.40 — Why three landing modules.** Provenance ends up in the filename: open
`modules/hooks.txt` and see exactly what got in behind LiNix's back. One `local.txt` mixes
them and forgets which was which.

**V.41 — Why "detected, not configured".** LiNix should not be *told* you have btrfs; it
should look. Not told you have four cores. Almost every "local fact" in `config.toml` is
something LiNix could work out in a second and instead asks you to maintain by hand, forever,
on every machine. **That is not configuration, it's homework.** (And `max_parallel` is
overwritten at `sync/mod.rs:296` anyway, so the setting is already a lie.)

**V.43 — Why the guard has nine refusals and not five.** The first draft said five (then
listed six). It was written before anyone re-read `policy.toml`, which held five rules and
was marked in II.17 as moving to `[guard]`. Two of them had somewhere to go —
`deny_packages` was already in the list, and `allow_backends` is what the `priority` file
means (V.15). **The other three had nowhere, and "delete" was never decided — it was
overlooked.** `pinned_only`, `require_snapshot` and `deny_vulnerable` are all exactly the
shape V.26 defines: not "I want this" but "I will not do that". They are refusals, so they
live where refusals live, and `-y` cannot skip them for the same reason it cannot skip any
other (V.22). *Corrected knowingly against the headline: a wrong number in a document is
cheaper than three deleted safety rails. If a rule here ever stops being a refusal and
starts being a preference, that is the signal it does not belong in `[guard]`.*

**V.42 — Why the comment rule.** This codebase has been touched by many AIs, and this is what
that leaves behind: models narrate what they just wrote and congratulate themselves for it,
because that reads like effort, and each one looks fine on its own. The repo already proves
the rule works — `core/manager.rs:86-93` explains *why* the `tracks_manual` gate exists and
what happens if it's wrong; `generic.rs:363-370` explains in nine lines that choco lists
Title-case "Wget" for install-id "wget" so `remove` silently no-ops, and why the fix must be
Windows-only because npm has `socket.io`. **Those two are worth more than the other 137
combined, and they're the same length.** The cost of the rest is that **they trained everyone
to skip** — the reason 32 comments in this repo are outright false, each of which someone read
past. *(The first draft's example, `audit()` documented as "a **destructive** Discovery cycle …
without generating files or acquiring state", has since been fixed in the code and now reads
correctly. The measured 32 are the ones that remain.)*

# Part VI — Bugs

## VI.1 Killed by this design — no work needed

- `-g` replaced the wish list while the ownership record never moved → phantom drift → the
  purge. **(C2, C4, C5, C6, C14, D1, D2)**
- `keep.txt` read as a wish list. **(E2, E10)**
- Undefined manifest read order. **(C4)**
- `upgrade --profile` matches zero packages, always — builds `manifest:work`, tags are
  `manifest:work.txt`, and per-profile provenance is destroyed at materialize time anyway.
  **(verified)**
- `-vim` in a manifest becomes a package named `-vim` while the README documents it as
  exclusion. **(verified)**
- Generations record absolute paths → rollback writes to a dead directory and reports
  success. **(verified)**
- Generation ids are epoch seconds → two syncs in one second silently overwrite history.
  **(verified)**
- `config.toml` never travels with history.
- "Rollback" means two things depending on flags; `undo` assigns the registry by fiat.
- Manifests stored twice on independent budgets.
- Two snapshot retention engines. **(E4)**
- Every bundle restore is unverified by construction. **(H1)**
- `linix repo add` records nothing → modules are not portable.
- `linix shim --source` is required, documented, and thrown away; `reconcile_shims` is
  written and never called. **(verified)**
- Holds (machine-local) silently beat signed locks (portable).
- `@lease=` in a manifest is inert. `remove --temp` is undone by the next sync.
- `orphans` message false on both counts. **(C12)**
- "prune" means four things. **(E3)** "orphans" means two plus a dead third. **(E5)**
- `confirm_destructive` gates the wrong thing. **(E12)**
- Any typo becomes a package name.
- `ScopedFilter::None` — an implicit spare-everything switch.

## VI.2 Carried forward — still real work

| | |
|---|---|
| **C1** | `uninstall` never consults protection. `linix uninstall libc6` proceeds → **Phase 3** |
| **C3** | lease and `absent:` removals skip protection, three lines above a drift branch that checks it → **Phase 3** |
| **C8** | ghost-shell exit force-removes with no protection, no guard, no confirmation → **Phase 3** |
| **C9** | lease expiry implemented twice with different semantics; the sweep runs on every state-changing command → **Phase 3** |
| **C13** | five `backend:name` parsers, three skip validation → **Phase 1** |
| **B3** | `unprotected_packages` doesn't beat OS-essential; `linix protected` reports the opposite of what the guard does → **Phase 3** |
| **E6** | "unmanaged" has two implementations that will disagree. Resolve as *"what `adopt` would adopt"* — one function → **Phase 2** |
| **E11** | suspension restore implemented twice → **Phase 3** |
| **F1** | `network_timeout_secs` lies (`.max(10)` floor); `max_parallel` detected; `priority` reason in a comment → **Phase 5** |
| **F3** | ~884 marketing comments + **32 false ones** → **Phase 0**. The rule → `CLAUDE.md` → **Phase 5** |
| **F4** | 33 vs 50 backends. **(measured: 41 registration sites)** Compute it → **Phase 5** |
| **F5** | false doc comments → **Phase 5** |
| **G2** | 104 of 245 assertions are `soft` and cannot fail → **Phase 5** |
| **G3** | teleport, adopt, shim, cockpit, undo unverified → **Phase 5** |
| **H2** | `sync/mod.rs:463`, `shell/mod.rs:126` → **Phase 5** |
| — | `bundle` has no restore code and no end-to-end test → **Phase 4** |
| — | air-gap artifacts need the whole dependency tree, and most backends can't → **Phase 4** |

## VI.3 Do not re-decide these

Three suspicions did not survive scrutiny:

- `matches!(b, "choco"|"scoop"|"winget")` at `generic.rs:363` is the **only** such site, and
  its comment is the best in the repo.
- `.unwrap()` density: 192 total looks alarming, but outside tests the max is **5 in one
  file** and ≤2 elsewhere.
- `bisect`, `fleet`, `conflicts`, `generation` are real, unit-tested implementations, not
  stubs.
